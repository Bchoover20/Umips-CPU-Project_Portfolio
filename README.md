# Umips-CPU-Project_Portfolio
MIPS Assembly, Logisim, Single Cycle CPU

Used internal modules and logic gates to create/connect a Register File, Control, and Arithmetic Logic Unit. Also added Program Counter, Instruction Memory (ROM), signed and unsigned extension, branching and jumping, and lastly Data Memory (RAM).
â€¢
It is a functional 16-bit MIPS based CPU architecture that while clock signal is being ticked, can read a program translated from assembly into machine code and when necessary, show results in a hexadecimal display all within Logisim.
